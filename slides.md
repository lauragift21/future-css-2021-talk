# The Past: CSS History

> Since 1996, We've seen CSS evolve into what we have today, from CSS 1, CSS 2, and CSS 3.

Remember when websites were styled like this? 

Well, a lot has changed over the years.

We've even gone from styling layouts with Floats for positioning, IE Support for Styles and Tableessss to more modern layout and styles like we have to today.

<arrow v-click="3" x1="400" y1="420" x2="230" y2="330" color="#564" width="3" arrowSize="1" />

I'm pretty sure most of us keep up with the latest in CSS world so some of these might already be familair to you. -->
